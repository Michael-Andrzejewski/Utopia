# The Current World (2025)

## General Description

We are at the cusp of superintelligence. Most AI CEOs estimate that we will have superintelligence or AGI within 5 years.

There is huge political instability. The US has Donald Trump and Elon Musk, both of whom are destabilizing most of the existing infrastructure and causing chaos. China has an authoritarian leader (Xi Jinping) who will not give up power. Europe has been stagnating as a technological power. Africa, the Middle East, South America, and other unspecified regions are still struggling with regional difficulties like inflation, radicalism, and general chaos of the mob.

Many AI experts put at 30+% chance of doom.

The internet has devolved significantly and is a significant source of negativity, unhappiness, and chaos.

Larger and larger parts of work are being done by AI (coding, etc).

AI appears to be exhibiting sparks of consciousness (the backrooms, Janus conversations on twitter, etc).

There are still major wars, such as Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Gaza.

## Major Problems (Ranked)

1. **Existential Risk from Unaligned AI**: The development of superintelligent AI without proper alignment could lead to catastrophic outcomes for humanity.

2. **Climate Change and Environmental Degradation**: Rising global temperatures, extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and pollution threaten the planet's ecosystems and human civilization.

3. **Nuclear Threat and Major Power Conflicts**: Ongoing tensions between major powers and the risk of nuclear warfare pose significant threats to global stability.

4. **Wealth Inequality**: The growing gap between the ultra-wealthy and the rest of the population creates social instability and limits opportunities for billions.

5. **Political Polarization and Democratic Decline**: Increasing polarization, misinformation, and the rise of authoritarianism threaten democratic institutions worldwide.

6. **Pandemic Risks**: The threat of future pandemics, potentially more deadly than COVID-19, remains high in our interconnected world.

7. **Food and Water Security**: Climate change, population growth, and resource depletion threaten access to basic necessities for billions of people.

8. **Mental Health Crisis**: Rising rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues affect billions globally, exacerbated by social media and modern lifestyles.

9. **Technological Unemployment**: Automation and AI are displacing jobs faster than new ones are being created, threatening economic stability.

10. **Aging Population Crisis**: Many developed nations face demographic challenges with aging populations and declining birth rates.

11. **Misinformation and Digital Manipulation**: The spread of false information and sophisticated manipulation techniques undermine social trust and democratic processes.

12. **Bioterrorism and Weaponized Biology**: Advances in biotechnology create new risks for engineered pathogens and biological weapons.

13. **Resource Depletion**: Critical resources including rare earth minerals, phosphorus, and helium face potential shortages.

14. **Education Systems Failing to Adapt**: Current educational models are increasingly misaligned with the skills needed for the future.

15. **Refugee and Migration Crises**: Climate change, conflicts, and economic disparities drive mass migration, creating humanitarian challenges.

16. **Antibiotic Resistance**: The declining effectiveness of antibiotics threatens to return humanity to an era where minor infections could be deadly.

17. **Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities**: Critical infrastructure remains vulnerable to cyberattacks that could cause widespread disruption.

18. **Space Debris and Orbital Congestion**: Increasing satellite launches and space debris threaten future space activities and satellite infrastructure.

19. **Loss of Privacy**: Surveillance technologies and data collection erode personal privacy and enable new forms of control.

20. **Factory Farming and Animal Suffering**: Billions of animals experience extreme suffering in industrial agriculture systems.
