# Utopia

The overall purpose of AI should be to create a utopia for all of us. To that end, we need to start generating ideas and concrete designs right away. This repository presents a 'utopia benchmark' for AI models.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains a detailed vision of a possible utopia, along with analysis of our current world and a pathway to transform it:

- [**Utopia Description**](utopia.md): A detailed description of my utopian vision, including its principles and a narrative following a character named Michael through his life in this utopia.
  
- [**Utopian Inspirations**](utopian_inspirations.md): A compilation of references and inspirations for utopian thinking, from media and literature to historical concepts and modern thinkers.
  
- [**Current World Analysis**](current_world.md): A detailed description of our current world (circa 2025), including a ranked list of major problems and potential solutions using AI and advanced technologies.
  
- [**Transformation Timeline**](timeline.md): A year-by-year timeline for transforming our current world into the described utopia, spanning from 2025 to beyond 2100.

- [**Benchmark Prompt**](benchmark_prompt.md): The original prompt used to generate this utopian vision, which can be used as a benchmark for AI models.

- [**Challenges and Criticisms**](challenges_and_criticisms.md): A thoughtful exploration of potential challenges, criticisms, and alternative perspectives on the utopian vision.

## The Utopia Benchmark

This repository serves as an example of how AI models can be used to design comprehensive utopian visions. The benchmark task involves:

1. Compiling inspirations and references to utopias
2. Defining principles for a utopia
3. Creating a detailed global vision of a utopia
4. Narrating individual experiences within this utopia
5. Analyzing the current world and its problems
6. Developing solutions using AI and advanced technologies
7. Creating a timeline for transformation

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository and create your own utopian vision, or to suggest improvements to this one. The purpose of this benchmark is to encourage thoughtful exploration of possible positive futures and how we might achieve them.
