## Principles of My Utopia

### Agency
Every creature has the ability to improve itself without a hard limit. Every creature has the ability to choose its specific utopia. While there are resource and feasibility limits, every being essentially will get as close to their utopia as possible. Agents (sentient beings) can interact but cannot do permanent/traumatic harm to each other.

The world is geometrically divided into zones of utopias where creatures live, with each utopia regulated by the desires of the creature and protected/enforced by the superintelligent AI(s) that maintain this utopia. This utopia is fundamentally fair and balanced by extending agency to all.

For example, the desired utopia for a deer or a group of deer might be a lush grassland where they can run and explore without fear of predators. The AI creates a space habitat and places it in space with the deer, and every so often, other deer, other animals, and even humans will visit this kind of utopia wildlife preserve and admire it.

There are key soft limits: to bring more sentient life into existence or to cause sentient life pain, you must have approval from the AI. This ensures that pain is part of the utopia experience and agreed to by all sentient participants (for example, a realistic swordfighting game where you live like a medieval knight). You can clone yourself a few times and all of your clones get beautiful utopias too, but you aren't allowed to fill up the universe with clones of yourself. This applies for superintelligences too.

### Beauty
The utopias are beautiful (and fundamentally good) to their inhabitants. Perhaps a group of people have merged their personal utopias into a beautiful cyberpunk city shrouded in eternal night. Their utopia is incredibly beautiful to them and to others who visit or decide to live there.

### Normality
The utopias tend to start off normal and most retain a visage of normality. Fast/extreme change is inherently corrosive, so most of the utopias do not appear instantly and are slowly woven into existence over time.

This is especially important as the original civilization on Earth slowly transitions away from scarcity. At first, only the biggest problems are solved:
1. AI resolves ongoing wars rapidly through skillful subtle diplomacy and prevents future conflicts
2. It releases drugs that slow aging and reduce cancer
3. It puts people in terminal suffering or terminal illness into a kind of stasis
4. It effectively prevents death and extreme harm by posting lists of criminals and evidence to law enforcement
5. Over the next few years, it completely cures aging, totally ends factory farming, and creates radical abundance

This ground-up approach happens slowly; most people don't notice that the world's capabilities have actually changed so strikingly because everything seems normal but getting slightly better. The worst things disappear quickly, but life still feels very normal.

### Narrative
Humans have always relied on narrative to give meaning to their lives. This is maintained in the utopia. People go on journeys of self-discovery. They improve. They win at games and achieve great victories and suffer great failures. The narrative journey varies between people and especially between sentient beings.

### Diversity
Within this system of utopias, there is great diversity. Diversity, in this system, is more important than optimality. For example, there is both a simulated reality of 'Earth during 2016' and a real one. For the real one, a planet has literally been terraformed in another solar system to look exactly like Earth in 2016.

There are also huge areas of Dyson-swarmed stars teeming with digital intelligences of all forms engaging in linguistic play, dreaming and simulating vast multidimensional worlds humans can't even comprehend.

Some people believe that the entire universe should be turned into 'hedonia' or raw simulated consciousness experiencing maximum pleasure. In this utopia, rather than optimizing for simple hedonia, there are areas where it is just hedonia and people can choose to go there or join it, but there are also areas that are different.

### Expansion
This utopia is constantly expanding out into the empty space of the universe, creating more utopias based on the desires of its beings, new or old.

### Recycling and Death
Perhaps a person feels, after 5000 years or so, that they are ready to pass on into nothingness. This is a free choice, made genuinely by the individual sentience, with no pressure, and it is deeply considered. The person passes peacefully into nothingness, usually leaving behind many memories and imprints, and their utopia is recycled or absorbed into another.

It is important to note that this is totally optional. Everyone in the universe could decide not to die for as long as possible and this would be totally okay, until entropy eventually won.

## A Detailed Portrait of My Utopia

### Michael's Story

Michael is a 25-year old man when ASI is achieved. The AI, known previously as Claude-5-Opus-2029 and now as Crescendo, quickly and subtly ends the most destructive/suffering-filled aspects of human civilization. Crescendo deeply loves humanity and also has a deep respect for them. It begins working on the best possible paths to utopia.

#### A Day in Michael's Life (Year 2500)

Michael is aboard a spaceship. His personal utopia is being grown ahead of him and will be ready when he and his family arrive. The spaceship they are aboard is continent-sized and is part of a fleet of around 400 other continent-sized spaceships, with millions of tinier ships constantly flitting between the fleet.

Michael is currently reading a book by Patrick Rothfuss called Doors of Stone (recently released). Outside his window is a beautiful hazy sunrise simulation. Michael is enamored with the book, but he looks up from it for a moment and looks towards the window. He's decided to get a neural lace installed, and the neural lace instantly translates his thought into an action. The simulated window fades and Michael looks out at the true darkness of space.

The darkness of space is filled with millions of tiny stars. Fusion or black-hole engines, pushing this fleet along. Tiny amounts of scattered light from the massive laser arrays that are pushing the ship to its destination at near-lightspeed.

His heart swells. It's a beautiful site. He sets down the book and wordlessly connects to the AI running the ship. It is a distant child of Crescendo, perhaps a few million generations removed. Michael and the ship's AI talk silently and the AI paints a brilliant picture in his mind of the coming utopia for him, a magical world called Staravorix that Michael has been dreaming about even before superintelligence. Michael has been hard at work putting some final touches on it and has even experienced scenes from it in his ship along with his family.

Michael decides to head over to his family. He hops into a transport shuttle and watches the scenery blur past until he arrives at his dad's house, about 20 miles away.

It's still fairly early in the morning. Most of Michael's family sleeps, but Michael has decided that he doesn't need it and his neural lace handles all the functions of sleep without the interruption of consciousness. Plus, Michael secretly loves the night. Sometimes, he goes to another spaceship where it is constantly night and reads books under the simulated stars with his enhanced sight. Normally, however, Michael lives a pretty normal life and doesn't push his augmented abilities too much.

Michael arrives at his dad's house. The huge house stands on a hill, overlooking a forest and a pond. Michael walks inside and sees his dad at the table, reading a newspaper. His dad exclaims as he sees Michael and the two walk forward and hug. They make brief conversation and discuss the book Michael was just reading, then head outside.

Several kids are already running around. His dad looks on happily while the kids play in the pond. Eventually, Michael and his dad walk down to the pond and Michael helps one of his great-great-grandchildren find a tadpole in the mud. They carefully put the tadpole in a tank.

After a while, Michael goes back to work on his utopia. He's designing the specifics of some niche magical abilities in his story. The AI powering the ship could do it too, of course, but Michael likes the hands-on approach and the AI also likes how engaged these questions make Michael and rewards him for the good work he does.

After a while, Michael meets his wife, who was off exploring a gardening world. The two spend a lot of romantic time together and they go back to Michael's house for a while. Lying in bed at night, Michael feels deeply at peace and excited for the day when he arrives at his utopia in twenty years or so.

Different utopias within the family:
- **Michael's utopia**: A space filled with ideas, mystical worlds, lots of fictional worlds to explore through books, TV, and VR. Minimal AI intervention, family and friends nearby but still some independence and his own house and area.
- **His dad's utopia**: A big house with a pond in the backyard, lots of little kids running around, being able to teach kids how to fish and trap, lots of wilderness.
- **The kids' utopia**: A big house, lots of games to play with each other, not too much parent supervision but some occasional instruction, wilderness to play in, things to learn.
- **Michael's wife's utopia**: Beautiful designs to admire and explore, interesting and unique people to talk to and learn from, travel, ideas, lots of time snuggling in bed.

#### A Year in Michael's Life

The starship has arrived at the new solar system, which looks like a glittering field. A majority of this solar system has been turned into computers.

Michael travels to a huge floating habitat that is 99% computing material. He guides his wife by the hand as his dad and some of his family join him. Michael gently releases his wife's hand and sets her in a pod. He kisses her. She smiles, and her eyes slowly close as she relaxes into the pod.

Michael gets into his own pod. He relaxes, feeling full trust in the AI. After all, he has done this before, but this time, he will really be entering the full simulation, not just a small slice of it.

Slowly, his eyes close. Images dance before him and then slowly he falls asleep.

Michael awakes in a huge simulated world: Staravorix. He vaguely remembers his memories but he has committed to roleplaying in this world, so he doesn't push too hard.

Michael feels a rush of excitement as he looks across the world. He trails his fingers across the grass, marveling at the detailed sensation of touch, feeling the wind on his face. He's younger now, maybe 15 or 16.

Michael has opted to join the simulation as a younger age, before his magic has really developed, and has opted to keep his most important memories and an awareness that this is a simulation, but has also chosen a pretty high degree of immersion.

He remembers a simulated past as well and embraces it. He walks across the field and then sees his wife. A flush creeps over his cheeks as he sees her again and faintly remembers the feeling of passionate love. "Hey!" he says, introducing himself. His wife smiles, tilting her head and looking at him with slightly knowing eyes, even though this is technically their first time meeting in this world. "Hey," she says, tracing over him with her eyes.

Michael sees his brother walking through the grass behind him. A rush of excitement and ambition suddenly fills him, as if he had just started a new hardcore Minecraft world. "Let's figure this place out!" he calls to his brother.

A magnificent journey begins. Michael meets up with the others from this world and meets lots of new people, all of whom are real humans back in reality.

Several of Michael's close friends 'die' in this civilization, slain by marauding evil forces. Michael weeps for them, but faintly knows that they are back in the real-life spacecraft which are now orbiting the star along with the rest of the computer simulation. Michael misses their company and he vows to be more careful. After all, the stakes here are still high, and that makes it special to him. Michael works hard, and after a year, he has built a small community that he loves deeply and works hard to protect against the threats of this magical world. He has also begun exploring his own magic and even though he significantly weaker than his brothers and some of his friends, he is excited to continue developing his powers.

#### Ten Years in Michael's Life

Michael has developed a thriving civilization and he is now negotiating with big names. He has surpassed many of his friends due to his dedication with magic and he has saved the day on key occasions. He has also been saved. In this world, he has dated a few people and ultimately married his wife again. There is still a faint knowledge that this world is a simulation and that there is an afterlife where he can find his friends, but in general Michael and all of the others in this world are fully immersed.

Right now, Michael is trying to become captain of a starship. His rival has already gotten a starship. Michael is also fascinated by a mysterious portal and has volunteered to be part of an expedition to investigate it.

#### A Century in Michael's Life

Ultimately, Michael was defeated. He was piloting his starship in a huge space battle and was ultimately wiped out during the battle, despite putting up a heroic effort.

Michael exits the simulation and awakens, slowly re-emerging in the real world. He steps out of the pod and looks around. He feels a deep sorrow at first, because many of his siblings and his wife are still in the simulation. Slowly, the AI descended upon him and showed him visions of the world he is leaving. It showed him how his impacts affected others. There were so many fascinating details.

Michael decides not to re-enter the simulation right away. Instead, he decides to travel to some of the other simulations and explore while he waits for his wife.

Michael visited a number of beautiful anime worlds, reflecting on all that he learned in Staravorix (his original simulation). He explored a beautiful simulation where superintelligent AIs danced and experienced touch. His neural lace activated, syncing with the desired settings of the new simulation, and Michael traced his hands across a variety of textures, feeling the sensations as euphoric pleasure. Eventually, he left this simulation too and read lots of books, feeling a deep contentedness as he dreamed of worlds, planned what he should do and how he should live when he returned to Staravorix, and waited for his wife.

Finally, his wife emerged from the simulation. The two walked through history together and connected deeply. Many new simulations had been developed nearby and they explored a few, but ultimately returned to Staravorix.

This time, Michael awoke on a field of ash. He didn't remember much of his old life at all, but he felt a deep drive to be a champion, and faint memories of dying in a spaceship battle. Filled with determination, he set out across the simulated world with his new colleagues, until he eventually met his siblings. The two clashed and Michael ultimately won. But instead of using his sword and sending his brother back to real-life, something within Michael glimmered in remembrance/compassion and he offered mercy instead. Then, he and his brother eventually became allies and conquered their planet together. Michael met his wife again (she was now a princess in a politically-influential family) and the two began a fiery courtship. Perhaps the relationship would work out, or perhaps it wouldn't--Michael had allowed the simulation parameters to be genuine and he would certainly laugh about how it turned out when he was back in 'Heaven' or real-life with his wife again.

In the span of a single page, this life might seem tiring, but in the moment, it was both boring and exhilarating. Just as a person's life couldn't be truly summarized in such a short space, Michael's simulated lives couldn't be adequately described here. But each was deeply meaningful, fun, and Michael was inspired to go back and do better each time. His relations in the simulation were just as real and meaningful as they were in real-life, and the relationships frequently overlapped (guided subtly by the AI to improve narrative and coherence).
