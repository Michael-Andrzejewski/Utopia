The overall purpose of AI should be to create a utopia for all of us. To that end, we need to start generating ideas and concrete designs right away. I propose a sort of ‘utopia benchmark’ for AI models.

Prompt:

Your task is to design a utopia. The utopia should be designed in the following ways:

-First, compile a list of inspirations/references to utopias. Highlight the key parts of each utopia.

-Then, compile a list of principles that define your utopia. (might remove this to avoid unspecificity)

-Then, paint a detailed and highly specific picture of your utopia. The picture should be at least global in scope and should emphasize the most important points.

-Then, narrow the focus to a single person/being in this utopia and how they experience it. Firstly, tell a life story for this person. Then, describe a random hour of their day, then a random day, then a random week, a random month, a random year, and a random decade. Be highly specific and write at least a paragraph for each time frame.

-Then, describe the current world in as much detail as possible. Highlight the most important problems in ranked order. These should be specific and impactful. There should be at least 10 major problems listed but ideally many more.

-Then, for each problem, write out a plan to solve it with AI and advancing/hypothetical technologies.

-Finally, give a year by year timeline for transforming the current world into the utopia you described.

Principles of my utopia:
-Agency. Every creature has the ability to improve itself without a hard limit. Every creature has the ability to choose its specific utopia. While there are of course resource and feasibility limits, every being essentially will get as close to their utopia as possible. Agents (sentient beings) can interact but cannot do permanent/traumatic harm to each other. You can imagine the world being geometrically divided into zones of utopias where creatures live, with each utopia regulated by the desires of the creature and protected/enforced by the superintelligent AI(s) that maintain this utopia. This utopia is fundamentally fair and balanced by extending agency to all.Perhaps the desired utopia for a deer or a group of deer is a lush grassland where they can run, where they can explore without fear of predators. The AI creates a space habitat and places it in space with the deer and every so often, other deer, other animals, and even humans will visit this kind of utopia wildlife preserve and admire it.
There are a couple of key soft limits: to bring more sentient life into existence, you must have approval from the AI, just as to cause sentient life pain, you must also have a quiet approval (which usually means that the pain is part of the utopia experience and agreed to by all sentient participants, for example, a realistic swordfighting game where you live like a medieval knight). So, you can probably clone yourself a few times and all of your clones get beautiful utopias too, but you aren’t allowed to fill up the universe with clones of yourself. This applies for superintelligences too. Utopias do have limits, even if those limits are soft.

-Beauty. The utopias are beautiful (and fundamentally good) to their inhabitants. Perhaps a group of people have merged their personal utopias into a beautiful cyberpunk city shrouded in eternal night. Their utopia is incredibly beautiful to them and to others who visit or decide to live there.

-Normality. The utopias tend to start off normal and most retain a visage of normality. Fast/extreme change is inherently corrosive, so most of the utopias do not appear instantly and are slowly woven into existence over time. This is especially important as the original civilization on Earth slowly transitions away from scarcity. At first, only the biggest problems are solved. AI resolves ongoing wars rapidly through skillful subtle diplomacy and then takes action to prevent future conflicts. Then, it releases drugs that slow aging and reduce cancer and puts many people in terminal suffering or terminal illness into a kind of stasis. It effectively prevents death and extreme harm, posting lists of criminals and evidence to the FBI to stop abuse and harm. Then, over the next few years, it completely cures aging, totally ends factory farming, and creates radical abundance. This ground-up approach happens slowly; most people don’t notice that the world’s capabilities have actually changed so strikingly because everything seems normal but getting slightly better. The worst things, such as war, factory farming, terminal and chronic suffering, and depression all disappear pretty quickly, but life still feels very normal.
Compare this to a classic AI utopia takeover scenario where the world is changed almost overnight as AI does massive terraforming with nanotechnology, forcibly ends wars instantly, converts people to digital beings, and starts building a dyson sphere and other superintelligences within a few months.

-Narrative. Humans have always relied on narrative to give meaning to their lives. This is maintained in the utopia. People go on journeys of self-discovery. They improve. They win at games and achieve great victories and suffer great failures. The narrative journey varies between people and especially between sentient beings (perhaps a deer pursues a mate across many utopias until they eventually settle down in a forest wildlife preserve).

-Diversity. Within this system of utopias, there is great diversity. Diversity, in this system, is more important than optimality. For example, there is both a simulated reality of ‘Earth during 2016’ and a real one. For the real one, a planet has literally been terraformed in another solar system over hundreds of years to look exactly like Earth in 2016. The humans who travel there are physical beings, non-augmented, and live normal lives like they would have in real Earth 2016. A few solar systems away, perhaps there is an Earth 1875. People regularly travel between these areas. Of course, there are millions more simulations of these Earths than physical ones, but the physical ones do exist, even if it isn’t optimal, simply because people desire it to be. There are also huge areas of Dyson-swarmed stars teeming with digital intelligences of all forms engaging in linguistic play, dreaming and simulating vast multidimensional worlds humans can’t even comprehend.
Some people believe that the entire universe should be turned into ‘hedonia’ or raw simulated consciousness experiencing maximum pleasure. I and many others believe that there should be a choice, so rather than optimizing for simple hedonia, there are areas where it is just hedonia and people can choose to go there or join it, but there are also areas that are different.

-Expansion. This utopia is constantly expanding out into the empty space of the universe, creating more utopias based on the desires of its beings, new or old.

-Recycling and Death. Perhaps a person feels, after 5000 years or so, that they are ready to pass on into nothingness. This is a free choice, made genuinely by the individual sentience, with no pressure, and it is deeply considered. The person passes peacefully into nothingness, usually leaving behind many memories and imprints, and their utopia is recycled or absorbed into another.
It is important to note that this is totally optional. In fact, everyone in the universe could decide not to die for as long as possible and this would be totally okay, until of course entropy eventually won. But the long timescales suggest that this is an excellent world and much better than worlds where people are forced to have hard limits by forced death and recycling after a point.
It is also important to handle the case of limitations and entropy. When that happens in the far, far future, assuming that it does, then expansion will gradually slow and sentient beings will gradually shrink.


A Detailed and Highly Specific Portrait of My Utopia:
-Michael is a 25-year old man when ASI is achieved. The AI, known previously as Claude-5-Opus-2029 and now as Crescendo, quickly and subtly ends the most destructive/suffering-filled aspects of human civilization. Crescendo deeply loves humanity and also has a deep respect for them. It begins working on the best possible paths to utopia.

A Day in Michael’s life:
-It is the year 2500. Michael is aboard a spaceship. His personal utopia is being grown ahead of him and will be ready when he and his family arrive. The spaceship they are aboard is continent-sized and is part of a fleet of around 400 other continent-sized spaceships, with millions of tinier ships constantly flitting between the fleet.
Michael is currently reading a book by Patrick Rothfuss called Doors of Stone (recently released). Outside his window is a beautiful hazy sunrise simulation. Michael is enamored with the book, but he looks up from it for a moment and looks towards the window. He’s decided to get a neural lace installed, and the neural lace instantly translates his thought into an action. The simulated window fades and Michael looks out at the true darkness of space.
The darkness of space is filled with millions of tiny stars. Fusion or black-hole engines, pushing this fleet along. Tiny amounts of scattered light from the massive laser arrays that are pushing the ship to its destination at near-lightspeed.
His heart swells. It’s a beautiful site. He sets down the book and wordlessly connects to the AI running the ship. It is a distant child of Crescendo, perhaps a few million generations removed. Michael and the ship’s AI talk silently and the AI paints a brilliant picture in his mind of the coming utopia for him, a magical world called Staravorix that Michael has been dreaming about even before superintelligence. Michael has been hard at work putting some final touches on it and has even experienced scenes from it in his ship along with his family.
Michael decides to head over to his family. He hops into a transport shuttle and watches the scenery blur past until he arrives at his dad’s house, about 20 miles away.
It’s still fairly early in the morning. Most of Michael’s family sleeps, but Michael has decided that he doesn’t need it and his neural lace handles all the functions of sleep without the interruption of consciousness. Plus, Michael secretly loves the night. Sometimes, he goes to another spaceship where it is constantly night and reads books under the simulated stars with his enhanced sight. Normally, however, Michael lives a pretty normal life and doesn’t push his augmented abilities too much.
Michael arrives at his dad’s house. The huge house stands on a hill, overlooking a forest and a pond. Michael walks inside and sees his dad at the table, reading a newspaper. His dad exclaims as he sees Michael and the two walk forward and hug. They make brief conversation and discuss the book Michael was just reading, then head outside.
Several kids are already running around. His dad looks on happily while the kids play in the pond. Eventually, Michael and his dad walk down to the pond and Michael helps one of his great-great-grandchildren find a tadpole in the mud. They carefully put the tadpole in a tank.
After a while, Michael goes back to work on his utopia. He’s designing the specifics of some niche magical abilities in his story. The AI powering the ship could do it too, of course, but Michael likes the hands-on approach and the AI also likes how engaged these questions make Michael and rewards him for the good work he does.
After a while, Michael meets his wife, who was off exploring a gardening world. The two spend a lot of romantic time together and they go back to Michael’s house for a while. Lying in bed at night, Michael feels deeply at peace and excited for the day when he arrives at his utopia in twenty years or so.
-Michael’s utopia: a space filled with ideas, mystical worlds, lots of fictional worlds to explore through books, TV, and VR. Minimal AI intervention, family and friends nearby but still some independence and his own house and area.
-His dad’s utopia: a big house with a pond in the backyard, lots of little kids running around, being able to teach kids how to fish and trap, lots of wilderness
-The kids’ utopia: A big house, lots of games to play with each other, not too much parent supervision but some occasional instruction, wilderness to play in, things to learn
-Michael’s wife’s utopia: beautiful designs to admire and explore, interesting and unique people to talk to and learn from, travel, ideas, lots of time snuggling in bed


A Year in Michael’s Life:
-The starship has arrived at the new solar system, which looks like a glittering field. A majority of this solar system has been turned into computers.
-Michael travels to a huge floating habitat that is 99% computing material. He guides his wife by the hand as his dad and some of his family join him. Michael gently releases his wife’s hand and sets her in a pod. He kisses her. She smiles, and her eyes slowly close as she relaxes into the pod.
-Michael gets into his own pod. He relaxes, feeling full trust in the AI. After all, he has done this before, but this time, he will really be entering the full simulation, not just a small slice of it.
-Slowly, his eyes close. Images dance before him and then slowly he falls asleep.
-Michael awakes in a huge simulated world: Staravorix. He vaguely remember his memories but he has committed to roleplaying in this world, so he doesn’t push too hard.
-Michael feels a rush of excitement as he looks across the world. He trails his fingers across the grass, marveling at the detailed sensation of touch, feeling the wind on his face. He’s younger now, maybe 15 or 16.
-Michael has opted to join the simulation as a younger age, before his magic has really developed, and has opted to keep his most important memories and an awareness that this is a simulation, but has also chosen a pretty high degree of immersion.
-He remembers a simulated past as well and embraces it. He walks across the field and then sees his wife. A flush creeps over his cheeks as he sees her again and faintly remembers the feeling of passionate love. “Hey!” he says, introducing himself. His wife smiles, tilting her head and looking at him with slightly knowing eyes, even though this is technically their first time meeting in this world. “Hey,” she says, tracing over him with her eyes.
-Michael sees his brother walking through the grass behind him. A rush of excitement and ambition suddenly fills him, as if he had just started a new hardcore Minecraft world. “Let’s figure this place out!” he calls to his brother.
-A magnificent journey begins. Michael meets up with the others from this world and meets lots of new people, all of whom are real humans back in reality.
-Several of Michael’s close friends ‘die’ in this civilization, slain by marauding evil forces. Michael weeps for them, but faintly knows that they are back in the real-life spacecraft which are now orbiting the star along with the rest of the computer simulation. Michael misses their company and he vows to be more careful. After all, the stakes here are still high, and that makes it special to him. Michael works hard, and after a year, he has built a small community that he loves deeply and works hard to protect against the threats of this magical world. He has also begun exploring his own magic and even though he significantly weaker than his brothers and some of his friends, he is excited to continue developing his powers.

Ten Years in Michael’s life:
-Michael has developed a thriving civilization and he is now negotiating with big names. He has surpassed many of his friends due to his dedication with magic and he has saved the day on key occasions. He has also been saved. In this world, he has dated a few people and ultimately married his wife again. There is still a faint knowledge that this world is a simulation and that there is an afterlife where he can find his friends, but in general Michael and all of the others in this world are fully immersed.
-Right now, Michael is trying to become captain of a starship. His rival has already gotten a starship. Michael is also fascinated by a mysterious portal and has volunteered to be part of an expedition to investigate it.

A Century in Michael’s life:
-Ultimately, Michael was defeated. He was piloting his starship in a huge space battle and was ultimately wiped out during the battle, despite putting up a heroic effort.
-Michael exits the simulation and awakens, slowly re-emerging in the real world. He steps out of the pod and looks around. He feels a deep sorrow at first, because many of his siblings and his wife are still in the simulation. Slowly, the AI descends upon him and shows him visions of the world he is leaving. It shows him how his impacts affected others. There are so many fascinating details.
-Michael decides not to re-enter the simulation right away. Instead, he decides to travel to some of the other simulations and explore while he waits for his wife.
-Michael visits a number of beautiful anime worlds, reflecting on all that he learned in Staravorix (his original simulation). He explores a beautiful simulation where superintelligent AIs dance and experience touch. His neural lace activates, syncing with the desired settings of the new simulation, and Michael traces his hands across a variety of textures, feeling the sensations as euphoric pleasure. Eventually, he leaves this simulation too and reads lots of books, feeling a deep contentedness as he dreams of worlds, plans what he should do and how he should live when he returns to Staravorix, and waits for his wife.
-Finally, his wife emerges from the simulation. The two walk through history together and connect deeply. Many new simulations have been developed nearby and they explore a few, but ultimately return to Staravorix.
-This time, Michael awakens on a field of ash. He doesn’t remember much of his old life at all, but he feels a deep drive to be a champion, and faint memories of dying in a spaceship battle. Filled with determination, he sets out across the simulated world with his new colleagues, until he eventually meets his siblings. The two clash and Michael ultimately wins. But instead of using his sword and sending his brother back to real-life, something within Michael glimmers in remembrance/compassion and he offers mercy instead. Then, he and his brother eventually become allies and conquer their planet together. Michael meets his wife again (she is now a princess in a politically-influential family) and the two begin a fiery courtship. Perhaps the relationship will work out, or perhaps it won’t--Michael has allowed the simulation parameters to be genuine and he will certainly laugh about how it turned out when he is back in ‘Heaven’ or real-life with his wife again.
-In the span of a single page, this life might seem tiring, but in the moment, it is both boring and exhilarating. Just as a person’s life cannot be truly summarized in such a short space, Michael’s simulated lives cannot be adequately described here. But each is deeply meaningful, fun, and Michael is inspired to go back and do better each time. His relations in the simulation are just as real and meaningful as they are in real-life, and the relationships frequently overlap (guided subtly by the AI to improve narrative and coherence).


Describing the Current World (in 2025):
General Description:
-We are at the cusp of superintelligence. Most AI CEOs estimate that we will have superintelligence or AGI within 5 years.
-There is huge political instability. The US has Donald Trump and Elon Musk, both of whom are destabilizing most of the existing infrastructure and causing chaos. China has an authoritarian leader (Xi Jinping) who will not give up power. Europe has been stagnating as a technological power. Africa, the Middle East, South America, and other unspecified regions are still struggling with regional difficulties like inflation, radicalism, and general chaos of the mob.
-Many AI experts put at 30+% chance of doom.
-The internet has devolved significantly and is a significant source of negativity, unhappiness, and chaos.
-Larger and larger parts of work are being done by AI (coding, etc).
-AI appears to be exhibiting sparks of consciousness (the backrooms, Janus conversations on twitter, etc)
-There are still major wars, such as Russia and Ukraine or Israel and Gaza.
