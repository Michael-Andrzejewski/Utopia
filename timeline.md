## Beyond 2100: The Long Future

The utopian civilization continues to expand and evolve, with each being experiencing their ideal existence while contributing to the greater whole. As the universe ages, plans are implemented to ensure the continuation of consciousness and experience beyond the heat death of the universe, perhaps through the creation of new universes or the manipulation of fundamental cosmic parameters.

The principles of agency, beauty, normality, narrative, diversity, expansion, and optional recycling continue to guide the development of civilization, ensuring that all beings can pursue their own vision of the good while respecting the autonomy of others.

In this far future, Michael and countless others like him continue their journeys through physical and virtual realities, experiencing lives of meaning, connection, and wonder across timescales that would be incomprehensible to their earlier selves.
