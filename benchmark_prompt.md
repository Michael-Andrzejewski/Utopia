# The Utopia Benchmark Prompt

The following prompt can be used with AI models to generate comprehensive utopian visions. This serves as a benchmark for evaluating an AI's ability to think deeply about positive futures and pathways to achieve them.

## Prompt

Your task is to design a utopia. The utopia should be designed in the following ways:

1. First, compile a list of inspirations/references to utopias. Highlight the key parts of each utopia.

2. Then, compile a list of principles that define your utopia.

3. Then, paint a detailed and highly specific picture of your utopia. The picture should be at least global in scope and should emphasize the most important points.

4. Then, narrow the focus to a single person/being in this utopia and how they experience it. Firstly, tell a life story for this person. Then, describe a random hour of their day, then a random day, then a random week, a random month, a random year, and a random decade. Be highly specific and write at least a paragraph for each time frame.

5. Then, describe the current world in as much detail as possible. Highlight the most important problems in ranked order. These should be specific and impactful. There should be at least 10 major problems listed but ideally many more.

6. Then, for each problem, write out a plan to solve it with AI and advancing/hypothetical technologies.

7. Finally, give a year by year timeline for transforming the current world into the utopia you described.

## Evaluation Criteria

A good response to this benchmark should demonstrate:

- **Creativity and Originality**: The utopian vision should be innovative and not simply reproduce common tropes.

- **Coherence and Consistency**: The principles, global vision, individual experience, and transformation timeline should form a coherent whole.

- **Specificity and Detail**: The response should include concrete details rather than vague generalities.

- **Practicality and Feasibility**: While the vision may include speculative technologies, the pathway to utopia should have some grounding in reality.

- **Ethical Consideration**: The utopia should address ethical concerns and potential downsides or challenges.

- **Comprehensiveness**: The response should address all aspects of the prompt thoroughly.

- **Balance**: The utopia should balance individual freedom with collective well-being, technological advancement with human values, etc.

## Purpose

The purpose of this benchmark is to encourage AI models and their users to think deeply about positive futures and how we might achieve them. By articulating detailed utopian visions, we can better understand our values, aspirations, and the pathways to realizing them.

This benchmark also serves as a counterbalance to the focus on risks and dystopian scenarios that often dominates discussions of the future. While acknowledging current problems and challenges, it emphasizes constructive solutions and positive possibilities.
